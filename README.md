# acf-repeater-tabs
## v3.8
A tabbed-view extension to Advanced Custom Field PRO's repeater fields

Stable compatibility: ACF PRO v5.5.12, WordPress Classic Editor

## !!!Not Actively Maintained!!!

## Using the plugin

The plugin extends the ACF Pro Repeaters Fields.

Once you have installed and activated, you will find a new radio field when setting up your repeater fields called **"Activate Repeater Tabs"**.

You can either leave this off, or turn it on for Vertical layout tabs. 

*(Horizontal has been removed until a smarter layout can be achieved).*

Turn this on, and the repeater tabs will appear for this field.

Drag and drop the tabs to reorder.

Click the trash can icon to remove the current tab, and the plus icon to add a new one (as per ACF functionality).

Hover for half a second on a tab and you will be given the option to "Copy" the tab, duplicating it and it's contents to a new row at the bottom of your repeater list.

Hover for half a second on the trash can icon, and you will be given the option to remove "ALL ROWS" in the current repeater list with one click.

This plugin works best with the **"Block"** view, however it does work with all three styles (Table, Block, Row).

Updated to work with collapsed rows.

Added extra compatibility for v5.6 (BETA)
